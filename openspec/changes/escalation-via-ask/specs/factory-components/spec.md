## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Escalation mechanism

The library SHALL provide a best-effort escalation mechanism (`std.escalate`)
that routes a blocker to a human through ptah's ask facility when one is
available and reports the outcome as data. The mechanism SHALL expose one
operation taking a required prompt line and optional details, and SHALL
return a status-discriminated outcome: `respond` carrying the human's
answer text unprocessed, `abort` when the human refused the ask, or
`unavailable` carrying the underlying reason when no ask provider could
serve the request (prohibited, unconfigured, provider failure, or end of
input). The mechanism SHALL invoke ptah's ask through an aliased reference
rather than a literal call site, so that a library-level ask never becomes
a pre-flight finding that blocks a consumer's `ptah check` or `ptah run`
in an environment without an ask provider. The mechanism SHALL accept no
configuration: ask-provider selection remains the operator's decision,
made outside script code.

#### Scenario: Human answer is returned as data

- **WHEN** the escalation operation is invoked where an ask provider serves the request and the human answers
- **THEN** the outcome is `respond` carrying the answer text verbatim

#### Scenario: Human refusal is returned as data

- **WHEN** the escalation operation is invoked where an ask provider serves the request and the human aborts the ask
- **THEN** the outcome is `abort` carrying no answer text

#### Scenario: Unservable ask degrades to an unavailable outcome

- **WHEN** the escalation operation is invoked where no ask provider serves the request — asking is prohibited, no provider is configured, the provider fails, or the input closes without an answer
- **THEN** the outcome is `unavailable` carrying the provider's reason, and no error propagates from the ask itself

#### Scenario: Consumer checks are unaffected by the library's ask

- **WHEN** a consumer shim requires the library and runs `ptah check` or `ptah run` pre-flight in an environment with no ask provider configured
- **THEN** no ask-related finding is reported for the library's escalation mechanism

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Package consumption

The library SHALL be packaged as a pesde package (`patextreme/ptah_libs`,
`luau` target) consumable as a **git dependency pinned to a tag** of this
repository — never published to a registry — and SHALL expose exactly one
library entry whose exports are the named camelCase surface:
`std` (with `predicate`, `gh`, `daemon`, `sessionConfig`, and `escalate`),
`openspec`, and `prReviewLoop`. Deep-path requires into the library tree
SHALL NOT be part of the supported consumer surface.

#### Scenario: Consumer installs as a git dependency

- **WHEN** a consumer declares a pesde git dependency on this repository at a tag revision and runs `pesde install`
- **THEN** pesde's generated `luau_packages` shim requires the package entry and re-exports its values and types, and the consumer's shim reaches the library through that generated shim

#### Scenario: Entry exports the library surface

- **WHEN** a consumer requires the generated dependency shim
- **THEN** `std.predicate`, `std.gh`, `std.daemon`, `std.sessionConfig`, `std.escalate`, `openspec`, and `prReviewLoop` are available on the returned table

### Requirement: openspec component

The library SHALL provide an openspec component whose instance exposes
groom, implement, and verify operations on a named change: groom converges
a change's proposals through review, implement drives task execution, and
verify converges verification then syncs and archives the change. The
component SHALL declare its environment requirements (an agent carrying the
openspec skills, `openspec` on PATH) in its documentation rather than
bundling or installing them. Convergence is the component's own loop over
the library's typed judge: a judge-rejected pass probes for human input;
a confirmed need for human input escalates through the library's escalation
mechanism — a served ask resumes the loop with the human's answer, and an
unservable or refused ask fails the operation without issuing a fix — and
exhausting the iteration cap fails the operation with an error reporting
the cap.

On a confirmed need for human input, the component SHALL ask through the
library's escalation mechanism with an ask whose prompt line identifies
the operation, the change, and the iteration state, and whose details
carry the work session's label and the full probe text. When the ask is
answered, the answer text SHALL be sent verbatim as the next prompt of
the still-open work session (no header or framing added), the iteration
SHALL count against the cap, and the loop SHALL continue toward
convergence. When the human aborts the ask, the operation SHALL fail with
a distinct error stating the human aborted the escalation. When no ask
provider serves the request, the operation SHALL fail with an error
stating human input is needed — the same wording as before the ask
existed.

The component's config SHALL accept `sessionConfig`, an ordered
session-config entry array applied to every work session the component
creates — every per-iteration session of groom, implement, and verify, and
verify's archive session — and `judgeSessionConfig`, applied to every judge
and human-escalation-probe session. The `model` and `judgeModel` config
fields SHALL NOT exist: a model choice is an ordinary `sessionConfig`
entry, and the entry order is the consumer's `setConfig` order.

implement SHALL accept an optional task scope: free text describing the
subset of the change's tasks the run is responsible for. When a scope is
given, the work prompt SHALL instruct the agent to treat the scoped tasks
as the entire job and leave all other tasks pending, and the loop's
acceptance SHALL be judged against the scope rather than against the
whole change. The scope SHALL be carried to the judge so the verdict is
made against the scoped completion, without the judge needing the work
prompt. A scope that matches no tasks SHALL end the pass with a stated
dead-end rather than the agent substituting a different subset, and the
escalation path SHALL surface it (an ask when a provider serves it; an
operation error otherwise). groom and verify SHALL remain whole-change
operations.

#### Scenario: Verify converges and archives

- **WHEN** verify runs on a change whose implementation passes the verification judge
- **THEN** the verification loop exits and the sync-and-archive step runs as part of the same operation

#### Scenario: Missing environment requirement

- **WHEN** the component's documentation is consulted for its environment requirements
- **THEN** the agent-skill and CLI requirements are listed so a consumer can verify them before running

#### Scenario: Human escalation asks and resumes

- **WHEN** a groom pass is judge-rejected, the escalation judge confirms human input is required, an ask provider serves the request, and the human answers
- **THEN** the answer is sent verbatim as the next prompt of the still-open work session, the iteration counts against the cap, and the loop continues toward convergence

#### Scenario: Human escalation abort fails

- **WHEN** a groom pass is judge-rejected, the escalation judge confirms human input is required, an ask provider serves the request, and the human aborts the ask
- **THEN** the operation fails with a distinct error stating the human aborted the escalation, and no fix prompt is issued

#### Scenario: Unservable ask fails as before

- **WHEN** a groom pass is judge-rejected, the escalation judge confirms human input is required, and no ask provider serves the request
- **THEN** the operation fails with an error stating human input is needed — the same wording as before the ask existed — and no fix prompt is issued

#### Scenario: Ask carries identity, session label, and full probe text

- **WHEN** the component raises an escalation ask
- **THEN** the prompt line identifies the operation, the change, and the iteration state, and the details carry the work session's label and the full probe text without truncation

#### Scenario: Iteration cap

- **WHEN** every pass is judge-rejected and the findings stay fixable up to the configured iteration cap
- **THEN** the operation fails with an error reporting the cap was reached

#### Scenario: Scoped implement completes the subset

- **WHEN** implement runs with a task scope and the agent implements the tasks matching that scope
- **THEN** the judge accepts the pass and the operation exits successfully while tasks outside the scope remain pending

#### Scenario: Scopeless implement is unchanged

- **WHEN** implement runs without a task scope
- **THEN** the prompts, judge acceptance, and log lines are identical to the behavior before task scopes existed, with completion judged against all tasks of the change

#### Scenario: Unresolvable scope dead-ends

- **WHEN** implement runs with a task scope that matches no tasks of the change
- **THEN** the agent ends the pass stating that the scope matches no tasks without implementing a substitute subset, and the dead-end surfaces through the escalation path (an ask when a provider serves it; the operation fails otherwise)

#### Scenario: Work sessions receive session config

- **WHEN** the component is configured with `sessionConfig` entries and any operation runs
- **THEN** every per-iteration work session, and verify's archive session, receives the entries in declared order before its first prompt

#### Scenario: Judge and probe sessions receive judge session config

- **WHEN** the component is configured with `judgeSessionConfig` entries and any operation runs
- **THEN** every judge session and every human-escalation-probe session receives the entries in declared order before its prompt

#### Scenario: Removed model field is a type error

- **WHEN** a consumer shim configures the removed `model` or `judgeModel` field and runs `ptah check`
- **THEN** check reports a type error naming the unknown field, steering the consumer to the `sessionConfig` entry form

### Requirement: PR review loop component

The library SHALL provide a PR review loop component that runs a
review→fix→push convergence against a pull request, with repository-specific
settings (agent prompts, reviewer instruction text, dry-run gating)
expressed as config rather than code. The target repository SHALL NOT be
component config: it arrives per call inside the PR URL.

On a confirmed need for human input (the escalation judge confirms the
blocking findings need a human), the loop SHALL ask through the library's
escalation mechanism with an ask whose prompt line identifies the loop and
the PR URL and the iteration state, and whose details carry the work
session's label and the full probe text. When the ask is answered, the
answer text SHALL be sent verbatim as the next prompt of the still-open
work session (no header or framing added), the commit-and-push step SHALL
still follow the human-guided fix (gated by dry-run as any fix), the
iteration SHALL count against the cap, and the loop SHALL continue toward
convergence. When the human aborts the ask, the operation SHALL fail with
a distinct error stating the human aborted the escalation. When no ask
provider serves the request, the operation SHALL fail with an error
stating human input is needed to resolve the findings — the same wording
as before the ask existed.

The component's config SHALL accept `sessionConfig`, an ordered
session-config entry array applied to every work session the component
creates (each review/fix iteration's session, which also posts the verdict
comment), and `judgeSessionConfig`, applied to every judge and
human-escalation-probe session. The `model` and `judgeModel` config
fields SHALL NOT exist: a model choice is an ordinary `sessionConfig`
entry, and the entry order is the consumer's `setConfig` order.

#### Scenario: Review finds fixable findings

- **WHEN** the reviewer reports findings judged resolvable without a human
- **THEN** the component drives a fix session and pushes, iterating until the review passes or escalation occurs

#### Scenario: Human escalation asks and resumes

- **WHEN** the reviewer's blocking findings are judged to need human input, an ask provider serves the request, and the human answers
- **THEN** the answer is sent verbatim as the next prompt of the still-open work session, the commit-and-push step follows the human-guided fix (gated by dry-run as any fix), the iteration counts against the cap, and the loop continues toward convergence

#### Scenario: Human escalation abort fails

- **WHEN** the reviewer's blocking findings are judged to need human input, an ask provider serves the request, and the human aborts the ask
- **THEN** the operation fails with a distinct error stating the human aborted the escalation, and no fix is issued

#### Scenario: Unservable ask fails as before

- **WHEN** the reviewer's blocking findings are judged to need human input and no ask provider serves the request
- **THEN** the operation fails with an error stating human input is needed to resolve the findings — the same wording as before the ask existed — and no fix is issued

#### Scenario: Ask carries identity, session label, and full probe text

- **WHEN** the loop raises an escalation ask
- **THEN** the prompt line identifies the loop, the PR URL, and the iteration state, and the details carry the work session's label and the full probe text without truncation

#### Scenario: Repository context is per-call

- **WHEN** the loop reviews a pull request
- **THEN** the repository context comes from the PR URL passed to the operation, and the component's config declares no repository field

#### Scenario: Work sessions receive session config

- **WHEN** the component is configured with `sessionConfig` entries and the review loop runs
- **THEN** every per-iteration work session receives the entries in declared order before its first prompt

#### Scenario: Judge and probe sessions receive judge session config

- **WHEN** the component is configured with `judgeSessionConfig` entries and the review loop runs
- **THEN** every judge session and every human-escalation-probe session receives the entries in declared order before its prompt

#### Scenario: Removed model field is a type error

- **WHEN** a consumer shim configures the removed `model` or `judgeModel` field and runs `ptah check`
- **THEN** check reports a type error naming the unknown field, steering the consumer to the `sessionConfig` entry form
